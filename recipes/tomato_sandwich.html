    <h1>Tomato Sandwich</h1>

    <p>Tastes like summer! Room temperature tomatoes are key here and once the salt and pepper hit them, the juices start
    flowing. When the juicy tomatoes blend in with the mayonnaise, it makes a delicious, creamy, slightly tangy, and
    flavorful sauce. The bread becomes slightly soggy, in the best way possible. The last bite is even better than the
    first!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 slices white bread</li>
            <li>4 thin slices ripe tomato</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice: You want even slices that aren't too thick or too thin. Use your best judgment.</li>
        <li>Spread: Use a butter knife to spread mayonnaise onto both slices of bread. You probably won't need more than a tablespoon.</li>
       <li>Assemble: Sandwich the tomatoes (in two layers) between the slices of bread. Make sure to liberally season the tomatoes between each layer for maximum flavor.</li>
    </ol>
